Section 356: Defamation
(1) Whoever, by words either spoken or intended to be read, or by signs or by visible representations, makes or publishes in any manner, any imputation concerning any person intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation of such person, is said, except in the cases hereinafter excepted, to defame that person.
Explanation (1): It may amount to defamation to impute anything to a deceased person, if the imputation would harm the reputation of that person if living, and is intended to be hurtful to the feelings of his family or other near relatives.
Explanation (2): It may amount to defamation to make an imputation concerning a company or an association or collection of persons as such.
Explanation (3): An imputation in the form of an alternative or expressed ironically, may amount to defamation.
Explanation (4): No imputation is said to harm a persons reputation, unless that imputation directly or indirectly, in the estimation of others, lowers the moral or intellectual character of that person, or lowers the character of that person in respect of his caste or of his calling, or lowers the credit of that person, or causes it to be believed that the body of that person is in a loathsome state, or in a state generally considered as disgraceful.
Illustrations.
(a) A says Z is an honest man; he never stole Bs watch; intending to cause it to be believed that Z did steal Bs watch. This is defamation, unless it falls within one of the exceptions. (b) A is asked who stole Bs watch. A points to Z, intending to cause it to be believed that Z stole Bs watch. This is defamation, unless it falls within one of the exceptions.
(c) A draws a picture of Z running away with Bs watch, intending it to be believed that Z stole Bs watch. This is defamation, unless it falls within one of the exceptions.
Exception (1): It is not defamation to impute anything which is true concerning any person, if it be for the public good that the imputation should be made or published. Whether or not it is for the public good is a question of fact.
Exception (2): It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion whatever respecting the conduct of a public servant in the discharge of his public functions, or respecting his character, so far as his character appears in that conduct, and no further.
Exception (3): It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion whatever respecting the conduct of any person touching any public question, and respecting his character, so far as his character appears in that conduct, and no further.

Exception (4): It is not defamation to publish substantially true report of the proceedings of a Court, or of the result of any such proceedings.
Explanation: A Magistrate or other officer holding an inquiry in open Court preliminary to a trial in a Court, is a Court within the meaning of the above section.
Exception (5): It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion whatever respecting the merits of any case, civil or criminal, which has been decided by a Court, or respecting the conduct of any person as a party, witness or agent, in any such case, or respecting the character of such person, as far as his character appears in that conduct, and no further.
Illustrations.
(a) A saysI think Zs evidence on that trial is so contradictory that he must be stupid or dishonest. A is within this exception if he says this in good faith, in as much as the opinion which he expresses respects Zs character as it appears in Zs conduct as a witness, and no further. (b) But if A saysI do not believe what Z asserted at that trial because I know him to be a man without veracity; A is not within this exception, in as much as the opinion which expresses of Zs character, is an opinion not founded on Zs conduct as a witness.
Exception (6): It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion respecting the merits of any performance which its author has submitted to the judgment of the public, or respecting the character of the author so far as his character appears in such performance, and no further.

A is within the exception, if he says this in good faith, in as much as the opinion which he expresses of Z respects Zs character only so far as it appears in Zs book, and no further. (e) But if A says I am not surprised that Zs book is foolish and indecent, for he is a weak man and a libertine. A is not within this exception, in as much as the opinion which he expresses of Zs character is an opinion not founded on Zs book.
Exception (7): It is not defamation in a person having over another any authority, either conferred by law or arising out of a lawful contract made with that other, to pass in good faith any censure on the conduct of that other in matters to which such lawful authority relates.
