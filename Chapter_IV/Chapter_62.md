Illustrations.
(a) A makes an attempt to steal some jewels by breaking open a box, and finds after so opening the box, that there is no jewel in it. He has done an act towards the commission of theft, and therefore is guilty under this section. (b) A makes an attempt to pick the pocket of Z by thrusting his hand into Zs pocket. A fails in the attempt in consequence of Zs having nothing in his pocket. A is guilty under this section.
